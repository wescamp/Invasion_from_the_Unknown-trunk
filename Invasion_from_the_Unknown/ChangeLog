________________________________________________________________________________

Version 1.10.5:
- Administration and maintenance:
    - Began to use inline formulas in WML to decrease code complexity. This
      means that this campaign will not work properly in Wesnoth 1.5.6 or
      earlier.

          This change means you've got to restart "Innuendo" or the last turn
          of The Heart to update your saves, since otherwise the recall list
          for the last scenarios will be unusable.
        - Prohibited plagued units (Walking Corpses, Soullesses, Ghouls) from
          being carried over to next scenarios.

    - 14 (Bye and Behold):
        - Balancing changes.

        - Balancing changes.

________________________________________________________________________________

Version 1.10.0 (interim release):
- Ported from 1.4 branch to trunk. Cycholka/Mist ran wmllint on it for
  making it compatible with Wesnoth 1.5.1 and later.
- Prevented past-the-end WML array access using new macros,
  VARIABLE_RANDOM_SUBSCRIPT and RANDOM_SUBSCRIPT.
  All WML found with the regular expression /\.\.\$[a-zA-Z0-9_]*\.length/
  was fixed to use this method.
- Removed many unused macros.
    - Ditch IS_ON_MAP in favor of mainline NOT_ON_RECALL_LIST.
- Switched back from ~ preprocessor includes to @, which allows IftU to be
  loaded from a mainline datadir if present. This is completely absurd IMO, but
  users of our SVN trunk have the weird habit of making the checkout in such
  exotic locations...

- Graphics:
    - Added baseframes: Elvish Civilian (bow attack), Elvish Avatar,
                        Elvish Ascetic

                          Elvish Trapper
    - Updated portraits: Dryad [P]

- Language and i18n:
    - Changed unit race text for female Demons from "race+female^Demon"
      to "race+female^Demoness".
    - Changed female unit_type names for the Demon tree to be of the
      "Demoness" form rather than "Demon".

      being moved to a public location reachable by this campaign.

- Scenarios:
    - Added first-time description for Elynia, Erathan and Althurin.
    - Character first-time descriptions and the option to skip them are enabled

      suggested by Espreon.

      engine bugs on arithmetic with WML variables containing real numbers)
    - Sanitized many event unit filters.
    - Some dialogs were improved (Shadow Master alone, with nobody's help!
                                  mwahahahahahhaaa!!!)
    - Turned Anlindë from Elvish Sorceress into Elvish Ascetic.
    - 1 (Border Patrol):
        - Map balancing.
    - 2 (A Real Confrontation):
        - A few dialogue improvements at the start - they also involve changes
          on the free recall mechanics.
        - Add an explanation for the Elvish civilians.
        - Other balancing changes.
    - 4 (Over the Sands):
        - New dehydration logic from Under the Burning Suns.

          (http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=305960#p305960)
    - 16 (Arrival of the Battalion):
        - Fixed a bug which made Quogar Ratham always speak a line that Erathan
          is supposed to speak otherwise.
    - 17 (Dawn of the Great War):
        - Fixed insane music fade-out delay after the initial character dialog.

          that were used before.
        - Drones now use Formula AI rules.
    - 22C (The Backyard):
        - This scenario is no longer enabled. The code will be left around for
          two more releases, but it will be disabled unless the WML preprocessor

        - Increased turn limit by 100; scenario starts at the
