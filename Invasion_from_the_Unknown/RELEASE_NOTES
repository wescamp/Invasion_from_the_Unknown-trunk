Thanks to the combined efforts of Cycholka/Mist, Espreon, Mica, Loonycyborg, Elvish Pillager, AI/AI0867, Kitty and Shadow Master [size=1](I cannot get away without mentioning myself)[/size], the next-generation release, 1.10.0, for Wesnoth 1.5.6 and later, has been finished and published.

This release introduces many additions, changes, removals and improvements to existing stuff, in any of the development areas (WML, graphics, story, scenarios, etc.). The changelog aside, this is a user-friendly list of what is new:

[list][*]Elynia's sprites were mostly remade since their appearance on 1.9.x.
[*]Some text in English was improved.
[*][b]New, original[/b] portraits for some characters have been added, thanks to Kitty's efforts. She's a human as all of us (right?!), so not all main characters have their portrait yet, but that will change as time passes. Be patient.
[*]New units have been added to the Chaos faction, replacing the lawful units they had on their hordes. These new units have mostly new stats and more advantages over the player, hopefully balancing the campaign's overall difficulty. The lack of lawful units should not be an issue as there are powerful neutral units on the enemy's side as well. The artwork is mostly frankensteins by Neoskel. I hope to upgrade them with time.
[*]Gold, strength, resistance, movement and ability balancing changes were made on both enemy and player units. The most notable one might be that Elynia's staff has had the Magic special dropped.
[*]Enemy drones in hives use a dumber AI, coded with the formula-based system. This is deliberate and works well thanks to their sheer number.
[*]The "last fight" scenario has been remade and it should be harder to beat now. As part of the remaking, the old bugs are gone and possibly new bugs have been created.
[*]Players starting straight from the campaign menu to Episode II can choose what Level 2 unit Galas should become.
[*]A new music piece by Rain has been added.
[*]Female demons are known as "Demonesses" from now on. If someone knows a more-correct-English variant, please let me know [b]as soon as possible[/b]. Correct as in well-sounding and coherent to other words, note that; as far as I know, there are no female demons on the English dictionary or literature, so I had no option but to use my Artistic License (tm) to make up something.
[*]Overall performance, engine code aside, should have been improved thanks to advanced WML techniques made possible since the 1.5.1 mainline release. I'm deeply thankful to the authors of such features for allowing me to untangle most of the macro and variables mess I had around.
[/list]

As part of the porting and improvement process, although we (specially Loonycyborg and EP) did our best playtesting the results, many bugs may have been introduced. One known bug is that difficulties other than Medium might be unbalanced to the point of being unplayable or just too easy to be a challenge. This is possibly the oldest known bug, but I expect this situation to change with time in this release series.

The 1.4 engine-compatible releases (IftU 1.9.x) are no longer produced. You can get snapshots with a few changes after the last 1.9.x release from the UMC Development repository. 

With your time and patience (and ours too), we hope to improve this campaign and make it even better than it was in its last installment for Wesnoth 1.4.x. I also hope to clean-up the WML of the campaign so that in the future it should serve as a good basis of what a "heavy" campaign should be made of (i.e. terrain WML, terrain-graphics layout WML, advanced stuff with units, etc.), and be another good example of [b]what can be done with WML[/b] besides what has already been done in mainline.

(The secondary reason for the cleanup is alleviating the load of the WML preprocessor when it generates the WML cache for this campaign. On a AMD Turion 64 at 800 MHz it takes about a minute, which is IMO plain excessive.)

***

A big [b]apology[/b] for the WesCamp-i18n project and their translators: the last two or three releases, at least, did not ship with translations; this was a mistake on my part for not having kept the wesnoth-umc-dev SVN entries up-to-date with WesCamp-i18n. This release ships with the translation catalogues generated for 1.9.x. As a consequence, most translated messages will be ignored by the engine, since the source text has changed a lot since their compilation. I promise that I'll do my best as the repository administrator and toolsmith to stop this from occurring again.
