                INVASION FROM THE UNKNOWN / ARMAGEDDON SPOILERS
                ===============================================
Author: Shadow Master (Ignacio Riquelme Morelle)

This is the Spoilers file for version 0.10.0. This file is a.k.a. "Changelog in a nutshell",
for people who suffer bad headaches when reading the messy changelogs I write. ;)

The main focus of it are the easter-eggs and oddities that I hid throughout this campaign's
scenarios. There are historical notes on development of scenarios too.

EPISODE 1: INTO THE DARKNESS
============================

Scenario 2: A Real Confrontation
--------------------------------
This scenario was a polemic one since the beginning of this campaign, and probably
caused it to sink into forgottendom at that time, until Aethaeryn, on #wesnoth IRC told
me his opinions on it, which was the first scenario at that time. I remade it and moved
it to be scenario 2, but it didn't happen until version 0.9.2, that I noticed that most
of the players that like this campaign's plot would like to see this scenario replaced
with something sane. I tried balancing the map and objectives, but I decided that the
scenario's plot overall was shit, and rewrote it, keeping just some dialogues. The result
is something that pleases me, a beautiful map and a beautiful battle, which becomes
interesting due to the mountains and clear grasslands near the enemies.


Scenario 3: Horrors from the Depths
-----------------------------------
- At 2,46 there's a hidden sign-post. The only way to reach it is to move a faerie
  along the subterranean river.
- At 24,39 there's a hidden village. The only way to reach it is to cheat by
  trespassing the surrounding walls and moving a flying unit across the chasm. The
  result is a nice easter-egg that makes you lose the scenario. Partly a joke
  at the www.wesnoth.org forum people, and partly a trap for cheaters.

Scenario 4: Over the Sands
--------------------------
- If you send an unit to the gryphon's nest at 11,32, you'll open a secret passage that
  leads to a secret level, "Cursed Plateau", skipping "Crossfire".

Scenario 5A: Crossfire
----------------------
- If you spare the fugitive's life, he'll give you a useful object.

Scenario 5B: Cursed Plateau
---------------------------
- Hidden in this scenario is a useful object, identical to the one
  you may obtain in "Crossfire".

Scenario 6: Moon Valley
-----------------------
- A Yeti hides in the mountains at the valley's SW border

Scenario 7: E1 Boss
-------------------
- If you kill the boss while Galas is in the opposite side of the chamber (i.e. looking at the
  eastern walls, he'll discover a secret tunnel that leads to the Secret City, a scenario 8
  replacement that, anyway, converges into the same dwarves-vs-trolls-and-loyalists battle.

Scenario 8A: Errand of Hope
---------------------------
- You can convince Eela and her companions to join your cause by offering them "fun".

Scenario 9: The Library
-----------------------
- If you step on the hex at 20,2, you'll unlock a secret area of this level, that contains
  the complete prophecy of the Union, guarded, though, by many shaxthal foes. However, they
  will attack your other enemies too. The touchplate and everything will be enabled at the start
  if you went through scenario 8B (Secret City) and found the same secret area.

Scenario 10: The Source of Light
--------------------------------
- The scenario's design is a partial replica of a scenario on my never-published-nor-finished
  campaign for Wesnoth 1.0.2. The only difference is that in that version you had to find a way
  to open the chamber of the Ruby of Fire, not Elynia.

Scenario 11: Strike on New Knalga
---------------------------------
- The scenario was originally designed to be smaller and worse for claustrophobic people.

Scenario 12: The Escape
-----------------------
- The scenario was originally designed to be on the surface, not underground

Scenario 13: E2 Boss
--------------------
- The scenario was originally designed to be on the surface, not underground

Scenario 14: Bye and Behold
---------------------------
- This scenario was always intended to be a gold-recovery area. This became
  however specially important after IftU was split into two episode.

Scenario 15: Shadows of Time
----------------------------
- This scenario suffered from a very tragic accident during its early
  development. It did not exist in the beginning anyway, instead of this one
  was a very boring scenario called "Dealing with Orcs". When this replacement
  was written, the author decided to go on campaignd crash-testing, accidentally
  wiping out all the changes he had made since the last released version of IftU,
  including this scenario's code. The map was salvaged from a saved game,
  fortunately, but the dialogs had to be rewritten. Anyway, he doesn't think
  it was much of a loss for the players, at the end.

Scenario 16: Arrival of the Battalion
-------------------------------------

Scenario 17: Dawn of the Great War
----------------------------------
- Originally named just "the Dawn", this scenario also went through many changes
  since its original incarnation.

Scenario 18: Voices of the Armageddon
-------------------------------------
- Originally named just "Armageddon", this scenario originally involved a simple
  fight against a lone boss L5 Imp. However, since it contributed little to the
  plot, it was replaced with its current incarnation, mostly thanks to Scenario
  15's creation.

Scenario 19: Legend of Wesmere
------------------------------
- Its name was originally just "Wesmere", but it was renamed to this play of
  words on Santi's campaign, "Legend of Wesmere". It didn't make much sense to
  me at the beginning, but now I love it. ;)
- This scenario will reappear (but with a more detailed map) in the sequel to
  this campaign.

Scenario 20: Under the Sands
----------------------------
- The dramatic sequence at the beginning and end of this scenario are nothing
  but a mere taste of what will happen next. (Hint!)
- The attached dark hive in this scenario is optional - you can destroy some
  matrices in it, which will slightly affect the economy of the foes in
  scenario 21.
- There is a secret glyph in the top-right corner of the map, which can grant
  Elynia a new ability.

Scenario 21: The Heart
----------------------
- This scenario was remade from a much larger (and boring) version.

Scenario 22
-----------
The short names used in this sequence are actually intended, referencing some
weird levels in the "Ecco the Dolphin: Tides of Time" game for the Sega Genesis
console, which had similar internal names (not ever displayed to the user,
except via debug/cheat menu).

A: Innuendo
    - There is a glyph at the end of this scenario which can be activated only
      by Elynia. For her to get there, it is necessary to have found and used
      the "Glamour" spell that can be obtained in scenario 20.
    - The glyph mentioned above opens the path to scenario 22C.
    - The location of the touchgem in the dungeon, which opens the path to the
      antechamber of Hell, is determined at scenario's start from a list of
      possible locations.

B: Gauntlet
    - There is a secret message hidden in a shaxthal's "nest".

C: The Backyard
    - Probably the largest map ever made for a single-player campaign.

Scenario 23
-----------

A: Interim
    - This scenario is actually a mix of three scenarios - each section has
      its own Time-of-Day assigned, and very different enemy layout/behavior.
B: Welcome to the Lair
    - Its real name is "Welcome to the Lair of the Shadow Master". It had to be
      remade several times for balancing and story design.
    - The Shadow Master here is an incarnation of the author of this campaign,
      just with a different name ("Argan" rather than "Ignacio"). This was
      intended to be so since the very beginning of development.
C: Broken Heart
    - Puntastic name time! :D This scenario is obviously a play on words of
      "The Heart" and the earthquake-y sequence that is taking place. It also
      references Elynia's own heart's state at this point of the plot.

Scenario 24: Epilogue
---------------------
