The continent was mostly dominated by Humans, who had eons ago established the Empire of Wesnoth in the Central lands. The Elves were distributed throughout the North-eastern, North-western and South-western forests, although small groups also wandered around Wesnoth or lived in the smaller forest areas. The Dwarves controlled all the mountains, hills and suchlike, usually competing with the fierce orcs and trolls who also liked that kind of terrains, and trading their precious ores with us, elves, and the humans of Wesnoth.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "The forests south of the Dwarven Kingdom of Knalga were known as the Wesmere forest. Eons ago, they established themselves as the highest and sole authority for elves of all other countries. We valued our sages for their knowledge, more than their age or military, or magic power, although power comes from knowledge, and knowledege from age, more often than not.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "The elves that lived there considered knowledge the most valuable thing in this world, so they were highly enthusiastic in investigating every secret of the world where we live. Every and each one, including the darkest ones... Though that gave us a great deal of order, discipline and safety for eons, as a civilization, it would not last forever.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Though, the first step towards chaos was performed by the humans of Wesnoth. More specifically, the Emperor of Wesnoth demanded the creation of a second sun, right after a major invasion of undead led by the necromancer there by your side...")}

Your pointless skirmishes are part of the cause of the sad situation of the Continent nowadays. And for some reason, the Emperor of Wesnoth emitted the decree with specific instructions of concealing the decission to me, while I was on the field trying to locate you. He rejected my duty as his advisor!")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "I certainly could do nothing since I was too far from Wesnoth to stop the action. They gathered all their magi, students and masters alike, to obtain the power necessary to lift a mountain and fixate it up into the skies. That is your second sun, Naia. Created with the sole purpose of destroying darkness and evilness forever. And it certainly worked for a time, but not forever.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Many centuries later, something horrible occurred in elvish lands. Nobody that is still alive, and for a good reason, knows exactly how it happened, but the most skilled sorcerers of Wesmere somehow opened a portal to a different world, during one of their many experiments. But things went awry and they awoke an evil and powerful force with it, which was incarnated in Yanqui, who adopted the form of a young elf seer. He told them that a great evil was going to swallow the lands and destroy the elvish civilization as a whole, taking with it all the knowledge they had collected over the years.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Predictably enough, he said that he would protect them if they worshiped him as a god. He also promised them unlimited knowledge and power to seal the pact... just what they had always wanted. Ambition blinded the minds of the Lords of Wesmere, so they agreed the pact, even though Yanqui demanded blood sacrifices as part of it. All those who disagreed with the decission of the Ka'lian ended their lives as the first sacrifices for the demon lord.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "For much time, these events remained in secret for the outer world, including the foreign elvish lands. The Ka'lian made sure with all their means that the news would not spread out of Wesmere. But something else was happening in non-elven lands...")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "The Emperor that ruled Wesnoth those days, died of poisoning six years after Yanqui's appearance in Wesmere. Some thought that he effectively commited suicide. Others were sure that he would not have done such a thing, and that the new Emperor of Wesnoth, a nobleman by the name of Dantair whom I did meet a decade or two before... he was absolutely not a gentleman. Now, he demonstrated that very well when just two years after the beginning of his rule, he demanded the creation of a third sun, describing it as 'an essential step to allow for further growth and prosperity in Wesnoth'. He was so confident on his political influences and the Wesnothian magi's power that he was sure people would surely recognize him as a 'rightful' ruler once that step was completed.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "But his confidence was not enough for reality. Since no necromancers or chaotic orcs actually threatened Wesnoth's safety for centuries since Naia's creation, the magi orders had fulfilled their ancestral purpose, and very few continued further study of magic. The masters of old passed over, and the new apprentices who came to take their place were a lazy and arrogant bunch. Nonetheless, Dantair went ahead with his plan.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "When the rumors reached me, I made haste to force him to give up. However, he must have predicted that, since he sent some of his best troops to stop me from reaching him. When I finally arrived to the valley of Weldyn, it was too late. The creation of Gaia was being attempted, and to my heart's pain, I witnessed all what happened that fateful day.")}

        {MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "Ugh... that day. I had to move to another home since mine was...")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "If you'll let me continue... as I said, the human magi's mastery of magic arts was not as strong as it used to be, and their attempt to lift and send Gaia to the skies was a total disaster. Their powers were not enough for setting Gaia to remain high in the skies, so... the mountain fell off, crashing down onto Weldyn, the empire's capital and starting a huge cataclysm that destroyed cities, valleys, even mountains. The landscapes and coastal lines would never be the same again. All that was beautiful and worth was then ruined. I quickly returned to my home in Lintanir, the North-eastern elvish forest, to attempt to keep order amidst the chaos.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "The humans struggled to survive, prey of panic, but they killed the Emperor, the magi, and their families, in response to their acts. I suppose that for the most knowledge-lacking citizens, magic was turned into taboo. Horrible wars started amongst Elves, Dwarves, Orcs and Trolls, altogether. Each kind's individuals would fight each other for the scarce resources left, except we... at least for a time.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Naia and Sela scorched all known lands, drying up rivers, fields, forests and lakes. Yanqui's power made Wesmere Forest stand intact, however. Green and seemingly peaceful. But he demanded unnatural sacrifices once more, and the Ka'lian agreed his demand and executed his orders. All foreign species, including elves from other forests, were declared heretics, not worthy of living.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "So, as creatures of other races, or elves from foreign forests came to Wesmere seeking shelter, the dark cultists sacrificed them to Yanqui. The pain and agony was feeding him, growing his power stronger and greater like a ghoul. When no more refugees came there out of fear, he ordered to organize raidings for capturing elves, humans, orcs, or whatever they could find in the outside lands.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "We, the Elves of the Lintanir forest, had to abandon our home for it would support life no longer. And so Aragan and I led my people out of the Northern forests. We eventually stumbled upon the Wesmere Forest.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Obviously, not knowing what was happening in there, we decided to ask for refuge to the Ka'lian. However, we were ambushed at night during our travel to the capital. Many of us died, elders and children included. Either killed during the fight, or kidnapped and sacrificed for Yanqui, as my husband Argan could find out. He risked his own life to reach the capital and spy on the cultists.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "So we found ourselves in a difficult choice - stop our brethren, the Wesmere elves, and free them from the great evil at all costs, or flee and let them continue their rule of cruelty, and eventually control the whole continent. Painfully, I chose the first, and started the lengthy War of Wesmere. Easily the last war fought on this continent since, at the best of my knowledge, we were the last civilization still standing back then.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Even though our numbers were superior, their religious frenzy, obsession and fear of destruction, almost led the Wesmere elves to victory. We fought with all our might, but that only called upon the fury of the demon lord, who eventually appeared in his true form, to attack us from the skies.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "With little chances of prevailing, Argan and I had to call upon the power of the Union, risking destruction by our own powers. The Union of the Darkness and Light was not powerful enough, however, to destroy the demon, at least not entirely - his regeneration power was stronger.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Finally, we managed to tear apart his body, and seal all the parts, and send them back to the underworld, destroying the portal that connected Wesmere to the underworld. Victory was ours. Wesmere, however, was a wreck, and no life was left there, except for a few survivors; less than one hundred elves. The few remaining Wesmere elves surrended and begged for forgiveness. We spared civilians' lives, but most priests and warriors left were executed and burned to ashes. We could not risk the possibility of another civil war, and we had to prevent at all costs that priests could summon forces from the underworld again.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "It's ironical how we elves always despised humans because of their moral, intellectual and physical inferiority. The humans may have doomed all the world of Irdya to chaos, but our own kin were the only ones responsible for the end of the ancient elvish civilizations. The fact that our civilization only rarely made mistaken decissions, but that the effects of those were always enormously catastrophic, is unsettling. This is why I fear that this may happen again. Yanqui was not the first false spiritual guide that inflicted massive harm on our people, but certainly the worst.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "To keep our civilization in one piece, we had to forbid telling the story, and execute anyone who would dare to tell it. But we were never sure whether we killed every cultist or not. Of course, we know that one of them escaped execution, since one of the commanders spared her life. She assured him that she was just a simple ignorant follower, not a devote cultist. I felt she had to be executed, but unfortunately the rest of my people did not agree.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "Anlindë? But... but, she...")}

        {MSG_UNIT Anlindë ( _ "I was a priestess, yes, but not willing. He would have killed me and the rest of my family if I rejected his rule! Of course, at the end he killed them nonetheless. I realize that I only delayed their inevitable fate.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Althurin ( _ "Why did the elves part ways?")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Anlindë wanted them to return to the Northeast. She said that we should have explored the unknown instead of retreating south. Of course, not every commander agreed, so eventually we departed different ways in a bad manner. Argan and I decided that our people no longer needed us, for Telchior and Anlindë would not listen to us. Quetor'el went South with his small group, but after the war I felt too weakened to be able to go with them across the desert. So Argan and I went here, to the depths, to live in peace. I am still surprised that Telchior and Anlindë could find a valley with life in the far East - I was wrong after all.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "However, in the way to this place, an earthquake caused the earth to break open. Argan fell to the darkness, and I could not follow him... Faithfully, I waited for years and years for him... I thought he could have survived to that disaster... he always managed to escape the worst situations... But then, I realized that I was waiting for the impossible. I decided to sleep for the rest of eternity, since I... I needed him. And he was no more.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "That's... horrible...")}

        {MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "My deepest condolences.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Don't despair. Although the force of the Union has been lost forever, I will try to help you in any way that is possible. I can't avoid, though, to be disturbed by the fact that someone opened a portal and possibly summoned back Yanqui. The being who did that, must have known this history in some way... or have done it by accident, which is far less likely. I certainly hope that it was not Yanqui himself or any other being of his own kind, the one who is originating this chaos.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Althurin ( _ "The individual responsible for this may be related in some way to Yechnagoth. She also knew of Yanqui somehow, or that was what we had been told by our hero, Rogrimir.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Yechnagoth, the Eater of Souls? But she's just an ancient legend told by mothers to scare children- but I guess that nowadays you can expect anything.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Althurin ( _ "Aye. According to the history, the Quenoth desert elves, led by Kalehssar, nephew of Tanuil and direct descendant of Quetor'el, defeated her in an isle far to the west, in middle of the unknown ocean. She could corrupt all souls from that place, including humans, orcs, nagas and saurians. After being defeated, though, that influence was gone. But a large fraction of humans were still controled by a powerful group of followers; I'd bet they are the ones behind all this plot. The 'loyalists'. They just want to expand their empire by taking over these lands and other to be discovered yet.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Interesting. So other elves survived and even managed to perform such a great feat. But somehow I fear that they did not really destroy her. It may have been a decoy; as far as I know, many ancient legends tell of brave lonely heroes slaying her. If the existence of Yechnagoth turns out to be true, what can be said of those tales? Perhaps her power is greater than we could suspect.")}
