        {MSG_UNIT Althurin ( _ "If you allow me to say so, my lord, staying here would ensure our death, or worse. The loyalists are already aware of our presence, and shall not stop until taking over Knalga and our lives. What is the cause of their obsession with these mountains, is unknown to me, but anyone can see that they have a plan.")}

        {MSG_UNIT (King Asthorgar) ( _ "Yes, although I don't see any chances for them to win in a real war against the Chaos Empire. There are many skilled fighters and wisemen in their side, but that will never be enough. If we dwarves could not resist the enemy forces with our most advanced technology, there is no possibility that the less-advanced outsiders manage to do it.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Incorrect. When I was just an apprentice, I witnessed and participated of a war during which a great alliance that even included orcish tribes of the North, was forged. We were fighting against a Necromancer who had, coincidentally, established his own empire; the First Empire of Wesnoth. I am deeply disappointed, I did not expect that you had forgotten those events.")}

We shall never have peace, or time for our own wars, if this menace is not stopped before our complete annihilation.")}
        {MSG_UNIT (King Asthorgar) ( _ "Well then, so your proposal is that we escape to the Northlands?")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Yes. Elves can go to look for help from the midlands, and you dwarves can explore the hills and mountains, to establish a new home if necessary. And then, when the rest of us are ready, we will call upon you to assist us in battle again.")}
        {MSG_UNIT (King Asthorgar) ( _ "I understand and agree, but, how are we going to make sure the demons do not follow us? We can block the tunnels, but with their machines, it would be just a small delay in the end. We need a distraction, a decoy.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Anlindë ( _ "I know, but as Elynia said, there are things more important than life. For me, our people's safety is much more important then. And death itself is not the worst thing that can happen to me. I commited great crimes in the past, indirectly; sacrificing our people for an evil cause. I cannot erase my past. If I am going to die, I would prefer it to be sacrificing myself for our people, this time for a just cause. It is the best I can do to try to fix the damage I caused back then.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Anlindë ( _ "My plan is for me to stay here, fighting and distracting the demons, with a tad of help from Keshar's power to rise the dead. Only me and the dead, while you flee to the outsides unnoticed. I'll fight as long as possible, and find the assault commander to vanquish him, if possible. That way, you would have escaped North by the time they might find out that you fled.")}
        {MSG_UNIT (King Asthorgar) ( _ "You are really brave. Surprising, for an elvish lady. We have really underestimated your people.")}
        {MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "In that case, I'll put some of my minions to aid you. And I wish you the best of lucks, may your soul rest in peace when all this is over.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "It saddens me to see what must happen so that our kind survives. I swear that I'll not rest until the last of those fiends is turned to ashes in the ground.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "Farewell Anlindë, you were my best adviser. And so I wonder why should not I make the sacrifice instead?")}
        {MSG_UNIT Anlindë ( _ "You are still a young and brave warrior, Galas. Your time to lead our people to glory is approaching. I, in contrast, have already passed that time, albeit I have never been a warrior. With my crimes, I cannot be a leader, but you, your future is to be a leader.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Anlindë ( _ "But let's not delay this any longer. Our enemies are preparing for a final assault, and so we should do. May you succeed in vanquishing this evil, and have peace in the future!")}
