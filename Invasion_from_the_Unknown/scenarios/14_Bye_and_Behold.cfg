The Emperor currently has a whole continent under his control, and he has slaughtered all of the survivors that did not join him. As we have just escaped a major assault force, I can tell you the great darkness that approaches. You will not survive much time with this defensive attitude; eventually, the enemy will destroy your natural resources, take over your country and exterminate the survivors.

        {MSG_UNIT Erathan ( _ "Well, I suppose that we cannot judge by ourselves whether any of you are telling us the truth, or not. However, if you come to the capital for a meeting with the Grand Council, we could settle this doubt.")}
