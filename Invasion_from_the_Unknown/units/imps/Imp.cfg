    description= _ "Frequently considered lesser parents of demons, the Imps are usually underestimated due to their usually small size and lack of intellect. It is to note, however, that a swarm of them is not a threat to ignore, even for an experienced soldier. They are mainly used by demonic attack forces as cannon-fodder to distract the enemy while the battle lords prepare the actual strike. However, it is rumored that some of these imps have grown bigger and stronger, enough to be a real strike force by themselves, which automatically promotes them to a higher level in the military ranks of Chaos."
