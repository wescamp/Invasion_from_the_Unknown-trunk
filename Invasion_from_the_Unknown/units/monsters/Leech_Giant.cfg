    description= _ "Leeches are very known for their habit of draining the blood out of bigger creatures. It is a fortune that they are smaller than a man's thumb.

However, in certain places, deep underground, giant un-eyed reptilians that behave as leeches have been spotted, thus leading people to call them 'Giant Leeches'. It is not known what these beings actually are, or how they got to have this body structure and habits. Rumor has it that they are eternally thirsty of fresh blood."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DRAIN}
